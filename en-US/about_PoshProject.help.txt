SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PoshProject is a simple PowerShell scaffolding module inspired from `Plaster`.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PoshProject is a simple PowerShell scaffolding module inspired from `Plaster`. It keeps
    a small predefined layout for the xml template with two major sections. One
    is `Configuration` which holds the `Project Name`, `Directories` to be
    created and `Type` of project. Second is `Metadata` which holds the basic
    and mandatory fields to create manifest file.
    It allows you to create a template, get the template as object, test it and
    invoke it to create your desired project folder and file structure.

EXAMPLES
    # Create a template for your project
    PS C:\> New-PoshTemplate -ProjectName "Azure-Health-Check"
    
    # Get the template object
    PS C:\> Get-PoshTemplate ".\Azure-Health-Check.xml"
    ProjectName  : Azure-Health-Check
    Directories  : Azure-Health-Check.tests.ps1
    Type         : Script
    Dependencies :
    Metadata     : PoshProject.Metadata
    
    # Test the template
    PS C:\> Test-PoshTemplate ".\Azure-Health-Check.xml"
    [+] Error Count: 0
    [+] Valid Template
    
    # Create the project structure
    PS C:\> Invoke-PoshTemplate ".\Azure-Health-Check.xml"
    [+] Creating Project
    [+] Creating Project Directory
    [+] Creating Root Module
    [+] Creating Module Manifest
    [+] Creating Pester Tests File

NOTE
    Test the template before creating your project.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    If there is any change in `Guid` in template file you will receive invalid
    template error. To overcome this generate new guid with the cmdlet `New-Guid` and add it in the template.
